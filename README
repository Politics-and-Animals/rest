	=== REST Gateway Plugin
	=================================

TODO: -API Key (Only allow access from registered agents)

	-XML result sets (only returns JSON for now)

The REST gateway plugin gets information on a journal in JSON format via HTTP. 
It can be addressed with the following URL pattern:

http://localhost/ojs2/index.php/myJournal/gateway/plugin/RestPlugin/...

...where, of course, localhost is the local server name, ojs2 is the path
to the OJS 2.x installation, and myJournal is the path to a particular
journal.

The plugin must be enabled in order to respond to requests. To enable the
plugin, or ensure that it is sufficiently configured, log into the Journal
Manager's "System Plugins" page, find the REST Plugin under the
"Gateway Plugins" page, and click "Enable".

The plugin has the following methods to request data:
